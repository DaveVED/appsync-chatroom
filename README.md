Serverless Websocket Chatroom

used the new aws websocket service for a week now

i haven't seen this good of a release from aws in a while - it's well thought through for advanced cases but also simple and lets you avoid heavy aws patterns if you want

and it's reliable and performant

the interesting bit is the fact that it's not called "aws websockets" but instead it's under the appsync brand as "appsync events"

appsync is a typically a very specific set of services for a narrower use case. whoever was in charge managed to overreach and ship a general purpose service so kudos for navigating aws bureaucracy - they should be given broader scope
